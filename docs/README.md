# Welcome to Juncture

**Juncture** is a suite of tools and services that helps anyone easily create engaging web pages enriched with visual content like interactive images, videos, maps, and more.

Juncture was originally developed by [JSTOR Labs](https://labs.jstor.org) and [evolved from a project](https://www.doaks.org/research/mellon-initiatives/plant-humanities-initiative) focused on using visual essays for digital storytelling. Visual essays are text narratives enhanced with interactive visuals that provide depth and context.

?> This is the third version of the Juncture toolset. The syntax for Juncture tags has evolved since its inception, but the current version is backward compatible. If you've already created Juncture essays, rest assured they'll continue to work seamlessly. If you experience any compatibility issues, please let us know using the Juncture Issues site.

## Examples of What You Can Create

This [demo essay](/docs/examples/monument-valley) shows what's possible with Juncture. It features a high-resolution image, videos, an interactive map, and viewer interactions—plus information popovers for places mentioned in the text. You can find more examples and inspiration on the [Juncture Examples](https://juncture-digital.github.io/examples) site.

?> When viewing the example essays, note that there is a link on the far right of the footer that, when clicked, will show the Juncture-enhanced Markdown code used to create the essay.

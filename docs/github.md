# How to Use GitHub to Create and Manage Markdown Files

## 1. Create a GitHub Account

- Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for a free account.

## 2. Create a New Repository

A repository is like a folder for your project.

- Log in to GitHub.
- Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
- Give your repository a name (like a folder name) and click "Create repository."

## 3. Create a Markdown File

- Go to your new repository.
- Click the "Add file" button and select "Create new file."
- Name your file. Make sure to include the `.md` extension (e.g., `README.md`).

## 4. Write in Markdown

In the text editor that appears, write your content. Here are some basics:

- **Headings:**
	```markdown
	# Heading level 1
	## Heading level 2
	### Heading level 3
	```

- **Paragraphs:**
 Paragraphs are formatted as blocks of plain text separated by blank lines.
	```markdown
	This is the first sentence in paragraph 1.  This is another sentence in paragraph 1.
	
	This is the first sentence in paragraph 2.  This is another sentence in paragraph 2.

	```
	
- **Bold and Italics:**
	```markdown
	**Bold text**
	*Italic text*
	```

- **lists:**
	```markdown
	- list item 1
	- list item 2
	  - nested list item 1
	  - nested list item 2
	```


- **Hyperlinks:**
	```markdown
	[Link text](URL)
	```
	
	- **Images:**
	```markdown
	![Alt text](Image URL)
	```
	
- **Inline code:**
	```markdown
	`Some text`
	```
	
- **A simple markdown file**

	Below is a simple markdown file with a heading, paragraph, and an image.  The paragraph includes italicized, bolded text, and a hyperlink.

	```markdown
	# Common Sunflower

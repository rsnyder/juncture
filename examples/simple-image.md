Upon first glance, the <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="2301,3670,1536,1242">background</span> of Johannes Vermeer’s _Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (c. 1665) appears black, especially when viewed against the light blue of the subject’s turban. However, thanks to the passage of four centuries, the original indigo pigment used to paint the background has faded, rendering its significance hardly noticeable to a modern audience more fixated on matters such as the subject's identity. The worldwide popularity and widespread use of indigo make this ignorance doubly visible. The pigment itself is not the only aspect of the painting that has faded: the often violent and exploitative context in which indigo was obtained and used during the colonial period has been largely overlooked for a dye whose widespread popularity has endured for millennia. For the purposes of this painting, it was exported from the Americas to the Netherlands, and therefore was most likely produced using enslaved labor.[^1] This is one of the many examples of indigo’s inextricable linkage with a dark colonial past. The indigo plant certainly carries a diverse history often associated with colonialism and the exploitation of labor. When paid greater attention, however, this history reveals overlooked art forms that contribute to a reframing of knowledge that reaches beyond its violent past.

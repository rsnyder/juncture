The [Amalfi Coast](Q212214) (Italian: Costiera amalfitana) is a stretch of coastline in southern Italy overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Gulf of Salerno. It is located south of the Sorrentine Peninsula and north of the Cilentan Coast.[^1]

Celebrated worldwide for its Mediterranean landscape and natural diversity, the Coast is named after the town of Amalfi, which makes up its main historical and political centre. It is a very popular jet set destination, and has been an attraction to upper-class Europeans since the 18th century, when it was a frequent stopover on their Grand Tours.

Attracting international tourists of all classes annually, the Amalfi Coast was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. Atrani and Vietri sul Mare are members of the I Borghi più belli d'Italia ("The most beautiful villages of Italy") association.

# Amalfi

[Amalfi](Q80563) is a town and _comune_ in the province of Salerno, in the region of Campania, Italy, on the Gulf of Salerno. It lies at the mouth of a deep ravine, at the foot of Monte Cerreto, surrounded by dramatic cliffs and coastal scenery. The town of Amalfi was the capital of the maritime republic known as the Duchy of Amalfi, an important trading power in the Mediterranean between 839 and around 1200.[^3]

Amalfi is the main town of the coast on which it is located, named _Costiera Amalfitana_ (Amalfi Coast), and is today an important tourist destination together with other towns on the same coast, such as Positano, Ravello and others.

One of the main sites in Amalfi is the Amalfi Cathedral. [The cathedral](zoomto/1894,1055,560,421) richly represents the artistic movement prevailing in Southern Italy at the time of the Normans, with its tendency to blend the Byzantine style with the forms and sharp lines of the northern architecture.

[Positano](Q81345) (Campanian: Pasitano) is a village and comune on the Amalfi Coast (Province of Salerno), in Campania, Italy, mainly in an enclave in the hills leading down to the coast.[^2]

The climate of Positano is very mild, of the Mediterranean type; the winters are very warm with minimum temperatures that almost never fall below 6 43 °F, while the summers are long, warm and sunny but often refreshed by the sea breeze. Thanks to the mild temperature and the beauty of the landscape, Positano has been a holiday resort since the time of the Roman Empire, as evidenced by the discovery of a villa in the bay. Typical are the many staircases that from the top of the village connect the upper districts with the valley area. The main beaches are Spiaggia Grande, Fornillo, La Porta, Fiumicello, Arienzo, San Pietro, Laurito and Remmese, some of which can also be reached by sea.

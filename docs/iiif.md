# About Juncture and IIIF

Juncture is built using many great technologies and tools, which are highlighted on the [attribution page](/attribution). A key cornerstone of Juncture's design and value proposition is the use of IIIF. The [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/) (commonly known as IIIF, spoken as 'triple-I-eff') defines several APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that standardize the description and delivery of media over the web. IIIF is arguably the most important technology in Juncture, and understanding what it is and how it works can provide valuable context when creating essays that incorporate images, audio, and video.

To get a solid understanding of IIIF, the [IIIF Get Started page](https://iiif.io/get-started/) is the ideal place to begin. Below, we provide a top-level overview, drawing on excerpts from the official IIIF site. Those interested in learning more are encouraged to visit the IIIF website directly.

## Why IIIF?

The benefits of using IIIF include:

- **Rich image delivery**: IIIF allows for fast, rich zoom and pan of images over the Internet, with options for size, scale, region of interest, rotation, quality, and format.
- **Plug-and-play software**: Any IIIF-compatible software can be used to view, compare, and manipulate images from any IIIF-compatible image site, regardless of the back-end server. You can swap parts of the stack whenever needed or even run multiple components in parallel.
- **Publish once, reuse often**: Deliver images from your site for various uses while hosting a single copy. You can embed these images in other sites without needing to transfer them for localized use, enabling seamless reuse and analysis.
- **Remix content**: IIIF makes it possible to assemble and reuse resources from across the web, regardless of source. This allows users to compare, build exhibits, or view items served from different locations in a unified environment.
- **Annotate**: IIIF has native compatibility with the [W3C Web Annotation model](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-annotation-model-20170223/), enabling content annotation on the web. You can comment on, transcribe, and mark up resources—even for audiovisual materials.
- **Cite and share**: IIIF APIs provide stable, portable views of images or specific regions of images. You can cite these views with a persistent URI, making it easy to share them or refer back to them in different contexts.
- **Attribution and access control**: IIIF supports attribution and access control via built-in APIs like the [Authentication API](http://iiif.io/api/auth/), consistent with the IIIF approach.

## IIIF Use in Juncture

The benefits of IIIF create a compelling case for using it instead of standard images, audio, and video. The interoperability, annotation capabilities, and the clear articulation of reuse rights and attribution are especially powerful for Juncture users.

Despite these benefits, IIIF has often been out of reach for many users due to the complexity of the tools and infrastructure required. This is where Juncture comes in—delivering the benefits of IIIF with minimal effort. In many cases, using IIIF is as easy as dragging an image into the Juncture editor. If an image is not natively in the IIIF format, Juncture can often convert it automatically and transparently, making the power of IIIF accessible to everyone.

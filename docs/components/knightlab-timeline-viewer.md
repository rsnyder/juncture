# Adding a Knight Lab Timeline

!> The `ve-knightlab-timeline` component has been deprecated.  The [iframe viewer](/docs/components/iframe-viewer) should be used instead.

The [Knight Lab Timeline](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) is an open-source tool for creating interactive, visually appealing timelines. It allows users to combine text, images, videos, and other media to present chronological narratives. The tool is user-friendly, requiring only a Google Sheets template to input data, and supports customizations for design and functionality. It's widely used in journalism, education, and storytelling to make historical or event-based content more engaging.

Previous versions of Juncture included a `knightlab-timeline` viewer component.  That component has been deprecated.  The [iframe viewer](/docs/components/iframe-viewer) is now used for embedding a Knight Lab Timeline in a Juncture essay.  Refer to the [Adding a KnightLab Timeline](/docs/howto/knightlab-timeline) howto page for more information.

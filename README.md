# Juncture

Juncture is a tool for creating and displaying interactive web pages.  Juncture web pages are created using an extended version of the Markdown language.  Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used to add formatting elements to plain text.  Juncture extends Markdown with the addition of a few custom tags enabling interactive viewers to be easily added to a generated web page.  Juncture uses GitHub for hosting the Markdown files and serving the web generated pages.
